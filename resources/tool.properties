# The category (or categories) of your tool, must be from the following list:

# If a value other than those listed is used, your library will listed as

# A short sentence (or fragment) to summarize the tool's function. This will be
# shown from inside the PDE when the tool is being installed. Avoid repeating
# the name of your tool here. Also, avoid saying anything redundant like
# mentioning that it's a tool. This should start with a capitalized letter, and
# end with a period.

# 'sentence' always will be prepended, so you should start by writing the

# A version number that increments once with each release. This is used to 
# compare different versions of the same tool, and check if an update is 
# available. You should think of it as a counter, counting the total number of 
# releases you've had.

# The min and max revision of Processing compatible with your tool.
# Note that these fields use the revision and not the version of Processing, 
# parsable as an int. For example, the revision number for 2.2.1 is 227. 
# You can find the revision numbers in the change log: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/processing/processing/master/build/shared/revisions.txt
# Only use maxRevision (or minRevision), when your tool is known to break in a 
# later (or earlier) release. Otherwise, use the default value 0.
